    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Potato fry is a classic side dish that goes well with nearly anything. Packed full of taste and spice, it is best eaten with
        classic south Indian dishes such as Rasam rice and curd rice, though it is amazing as an accompaniment to north Indian dishes
        such a jeera rice, pulao, and rotis as well.
