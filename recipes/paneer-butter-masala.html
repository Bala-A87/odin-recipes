        <p>
            Paneer butter masala is a rich and creamy curry made with paneer, spices, onions, tomatoes, cashews, and butter.
            As the name suggests, the curry is cooked in butter, which imparts its characteristic buttery flavor to the dish.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make paneer butter masala, firstly onions, tomatoes and cashews are sauteed with spices. These are then blended
            to a silky smooth puree forming the curry base. This is further simmered with butter and spices to make the butter
            masala. Lastly, cubed paneer is added to it along with cream, which makes it creamy and amazingly delicious!
