# Odin Recipes
This is a HTML-only website with a couple of recipes, made as part of the The Odin Project.

The website consists of a main page, that links to the recipes available in their own separate web pages.

The work done as part of this milestone project demonstrates a grasp of HTML, including the basic layout of a HTML file and the following tags in the body:
- h1/h2/...
- p
- a
- img
- ol/ul/li
